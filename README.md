Visual Studio Code Clone UI
This is a pixel-perfect clone of the Visual Studio Code user interface, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project replicates the layout and visual structure of VS Code, including the sidebar, top bar, and welcome tab â€” providing a clean, interactive, and customizable front-end experience.

Key Features:

Responsive and dynamic VS Code-style layout

Modular React components (e.g., Sidebar, Tabs, File Explorer)

SVG icons and assets stored in the public folder

Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
